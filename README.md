Web Scrapping
My first web scraping project involved using Python libraries like urllib.request and Beautiful Soup to extract data from a website focused on computer technology. Specifically, I scraped information on video card models and their shipping details. Through this project, I gained experience with web scraping techniques and learned how to extract valuable data from websites.
